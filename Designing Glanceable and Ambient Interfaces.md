Glanceable and ambient interfaces prioritize delivering information with minimal distraction, addressing the growing need for less intrusive environments. These interfaces integrate seamlessly into their surroundings, becoming part of the background until needed.

A familiar **example is a wall clock**. Most of the time, it goes unnoticed, but when we need the time, we can quickly glean it with a glance, even from across the room. Its design allows for varying levels of detailâ€”an approximate sense of time from a distance and precise information upon closer inspection. Similarly, well-designed glanceable interfaces offer users relevant information effortlessly, reducing cognitive load while remaining accessible.
