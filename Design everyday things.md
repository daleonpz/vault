## Product promise vs User expectation:
If there is a button that says "ON", the user expects that for example the lights turn "ON", but if something else turns off, there is a mismatching. 

## Design mental load
The user mental load should be take into account. For example, a kitchen should be take into account what other tasks would be the user be doing while cooking. User do not use objects in isolation, context matters.

## Memory, natural mapping
If you want to introduce a new products, it's usually a good idea to follow established rules. for example with the keyboard

## Controls that feels natural
It should be intuitive how to interact with the product. For example, a light dimmer control that uses a bar it's intuitive to think that if the value of the bar is higher, the light should be brighter.

## Signifier
The interaction should be interactive. For example, feedback that the order was received.
