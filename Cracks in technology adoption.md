1. First crack: 
It is a gap that occurs when a hot technology product cannot be readily translated into a major new benefit—something like Esperanto. The enthusiast loves it for its architecture, but nobody else can even figure out how to start using it.

This is a market development problem. The key to getting beyond the enthusiasts and
winning over a visionary is to show that the new technology enables some strategic leap forward, something never before possible, which has an intrinsic value and appeal to the nontechnologist. **This benefit is typically symbolized by a single, compelling flagship application, something that showcases the power and value of the new product.**

2.  The Other crack
Simply put, the early majority is willing and able to become technologically competent where necessary; the late majority is not. When a product reaches this point in the market development, **it must be made increasingly easier to adopt in order to continue being successful.** If this does not occur, the transition to the late majority will stall.

companies in mature markets find it harder and harder to get paid for the R&D they have done because the end user cannot capture the benefit. Instead, **they bemoan that the product has become a commodity when in fact it is the experience of the product that has been commoditized**. This truly is marketing’s fault, particularly when companies have ceded marketing the right to redesign the user interface and thus control the user experience.
