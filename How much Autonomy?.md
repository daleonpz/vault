On the one hand, we can try to create intuitable interfaces for users to control the systems themselves. This is where many consumer IoT products are right now: remote controls are often the core of the value 
proposition. The next natural step, also user controlled, is automation: the user configures functionality to run automatically in the future (e.g., by setting up heating to come on at 4 p.m.).

On the other, we can hand over control to intelligent or autonomous systems, empowered to act independently on our behalf (e.g., the heatÂ­ing system infers that it should come on at 4 p.m. because you are likely to be home).

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.
