There are two variables here: 
1. the nature of a person’s motivation
2. the nature of the environment in which he works.

An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment’s complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity,which we’ll call the CUA factor.

High Individual interest + Low CUA:  Free market forces -> a manager with a monotone job prefers a better payment. 
High Individual interest + High CUA: Nothing works -> earthquake where you only care yourself. 
Low Individual interest + Low CUA: Contractual obligation -> new hired
Low Individual interest + High CUA: Cultural Values -> car accident where everybode helps
