What the **early adopter is buying is some kind of change agent**. By being the first to implement this change in their industry, the early adopt ers expect to get a jump on the competition.
They expect a radical discontinuity between the old ways and the new, and they are prepared to champion this cause against entrenched resistance. Being the first, they also are prepared to bear with the inevitable bugs and glitches that accompany any
innovation just coming to market.

By contrast, the **early majority want to buy a productivity improvement for existing operations**. They are looking to minimize the discontinuity with the old ways. They want evolution, not revolution. They want technology to enhance, not overthrow, the established ways of doing business. And above all, they do not want to debug somebody elseâ€™s product. By the time they adopt it, they want it to work properly and to integrate appropriately with their existing technology base.
