To make sure you’re being heard, you should watch the person you are talking to. Remember, the more complex the issue, the more prone communication is to
being lost. Does your subordinate give appropriate responses to what you are saying? Does he allow himself to receive your message? If his responses—verbal and nonverbal—do not completely assure you that what you’ve said has gotten through, it is your responsibility to keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood.
