When evaluating customer feedback, the key is to gather concrete facts about their lives rather than simply discussing your idea. Initially, you might have a broad concept, like creating a cookbook app for iPads, but this vague idea doesn’t address specifics such as what recipes to include or how to reach your audience. Conversations with potential customers should be aimed at understanding their actual needs and behaviors.

The first conversation, even with someone close like your mom, often reveals vague feedback about your general idea. However, the second conversation, where you avoid discussing your idea and focus on understanding the customer’s needs and challenges, provides actionable insights. This approach helps identify specific customer segments and potential risks, such as whether niche recipes might be better suited for experienced cooks or if generic recipes could attract younger users.

**The Mom Test** provides a framework for these conversations:

1. **Talk about their life**: Focus on the customer’s experiences and challenges rather than pitching your idea.
2. **Ask about specifics**: Inquire about past behaviors and concrete examples instead of seeking opinions about the future.
3. **Talk less, listen more**: Allow the customer to share detailed information, which can reveal more about their true needs and preferences.

By following these principles, you ensure that your customer conversations yield valuable, unbiased insights, ultimately guiding you to refine your idea effectively.
