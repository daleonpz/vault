In the quest to improve your business, it's crucial to ask important questions that drive progress, rather than settling for trivial ones. While it's essential to avoid biasing questions, focusing on those that truly matter can be challenging. To identify these critical questions, consider running thought experiments—imagine your company has failed and analyze why, or envision its success and determine what had to be true to achieve it. Questions that could fundamentally change or disprove your business idea are the ones worth asking.

It’s important to confront and embrace difficult questions, even if they’re intimidating. For example, avoiding a question about legal ambiguities in your business model could result in significant losses or ask about money. Learning to appreciate bad news is part of this process; it’s a way to gain valuable insights and pivot early. If you face a dead end with minimal investment, it’s better than sinking everything into a failing idea. Always be prepared to ask questions that challenge your assumptions and reveal uncomfortable truths—this is key to finding a successful path forward.
