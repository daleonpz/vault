It turns out our attitude toward technology adoption becomes significant—at least in a marketing sense—any time we are introduced to products that require us to change our current mode of behavior or to modify other products and services we rely on. In academic terms, such change-sensitive products are called discontinuous or disruptive innovations The contrasting term, continuous or sustaining innovations, refers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require us to change behavior.

For example, when Warby Parker promises you better looking eyeglasses, that is a  continuous innovation.  On the other hand, if the Samsung were a 3-D TV, it would be incompatible with normal viewing, requiring you to don special glasses to get the special effects. This would be a discontinuous innovation because you would have to change your normal TV-viewing behavior.
