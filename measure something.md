the minute we choose to measure something, we are essentially choosing to aspire to it. A metric, in other words, creates a pointer in a particular direction. And once the pointer is created, it's only matter of time before competitors herd in that direction. 

consumers are looking always for metrics to compare.

But if we only pay attention to things that we can measure,we will only pay attention to the things that are easily measure. And in the process, we will miss a lot.
