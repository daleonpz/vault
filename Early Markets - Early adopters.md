Early Adopters: The Visionaries
Visionaries are a unique group of individuals who can recognize emerging technology's strategic potential, turn it into high-risk projects, and persuade their organizations to support these endeavors. They are early adopters of high-tech products and typically recent executives driven by a business-oriented dream. 

Their focus is on making significant advancements in how business is conducted, which includes personal recognition and rewards. Visionaries are crucial in driving the high-tech industry forward as they seek transformative breakthroughs rather than incremental improvements. They invest heavily and are willing to take risks to achieve substantial returns on investment. 

Moreover, they serve as valuable references and alert the business community to relevant technology advancements. They are quick decision-makers but difficult to please since they chase an ever-evolving dream. Managing their expectations is essential, and direct sales to top-level executives is the most practical approach to engage with them. In summary, visionaries present an early opportunity for generating substantial revenue, but dealing with them requires meeting high demands and accepting potential risks. Nonetheless, their support is vital for high-tech products to succeed in the market.

When Linda Dillman at Wal-Mart committed to install Symbol RFID systems to create real-time visibility into all the inventory in every Wal-Mart store, she was acting as a visionary.
