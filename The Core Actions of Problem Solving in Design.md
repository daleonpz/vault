Design problem-solving involves six foundational actions that apply universally, whether addressing large-scale product development or minor details. These actions are:

1. **Establishing the need**: Recognizing a problem that requires a solution.
2. **Planning**: How to approach the problem.
3. **Understanding the problem**: Defining requirements and studying existing solutions.
4. **Generating alternatives**: Proposing multiple potential solutions.
5. **Evaluating alternatives**: Comparing solutions against requirements and each other.
6. **Deciding**: Selecting an acceptable solution.

A seventh step, **communicating results**, becomes essential for collaboration within teams. 

**These actions are iterative rather than linear, with problem understanding and solution generation continuously refining each other**. This iterative nature distinguishes design from straightforward analysis.

### Observations on the Design Process

- **Emergent Needs**: New problems arise as designs evolve, requiring ongoing adjustments.
- **Dynamic Planning**: Plans adapt as understanding deepens during the process.
- **Sub-problem Understanding**: Each new detail or challenge demands fresh analysis.
- **Generation Modes**: Concept and product generation involve distinct techniques.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Methods vary depending on whether assessing ideas or tangible outcomes.
- **Decision Challenges**: Decisions involve incomplete data and require team consensus, which can be difficult to achieve.
- **Communication**: Clear sharing of findings is critical in collaborative environments like concurrent engineering.

This framework ensures systematic and collaborative progress while addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in design
