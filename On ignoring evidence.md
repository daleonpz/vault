You may wonder how using better evidence can possibly produce better results. It sometimes reminds us of the old joke about the two economists walking down the street hwo spot a $20 bill lying on the sidewalk. the first says' "Look, a $20 bill. Let's pick it up". The second replies, "It can't be possibly a $20 bill - if a $20 bill were lying on the sidewalk, someone would have picked it up by now."

Managers also avoid what's clearly in front of them; they simply presume they are already doing all they can to make good decisions, so there is no point in changing anything.
