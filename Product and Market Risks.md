In customer conversations, it's crucial to distinguish between product risk and market risk. 

* **Product risk** — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?
* **Market risk** — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of  
them?

The former pertains to whether you can build and deliver your product successfully, while the latter relates to whether there is demand and willingness to pay for it. For instance, if a speaker mentions dissatisfaction with their agent but is open to a platform that could increase their gigs, it’s important to recognize that their willingness to pay is contingent on whether you can deliver on your promises. This indicates product risk—your challenge is to actually build a platform that successfully connects speakers with event organizers.

Conversely, in scenarios like online advertising or affiliate marketing, the risk lies primarily in your ability to generate traffic or sales, not in the market’s willingness to pay. These markets are well-established, so if you can meet the necessary scale, customers will pay. The key takeaway is to focus on validating both market demand and your ability to deliver the product. Don’t get misled by customer enthusiasm alone; ensure you address the core risks of your product’s feasibility and scalability before fully committing.

**TIP**  if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk.
