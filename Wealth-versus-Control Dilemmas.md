Choosing between the options outlined in Figure 11.1 can be particularly hard for 
(a) founders who lack clear priorities. These founders may be equally motivated by wealth and control. On the other hand, they may not be that strongly motivated by either and thus find it particularly difficult to make coherent decisions. 

(b) founders who do not yet know themselves well enough and have not experienced the challenges faced by startup CEOs. (Founders who both have unclear priorities and
lack self-knowledge and experience will be in for a really rough ride.)  In this case, first-time founder-CEOs are often handicapped by at least four kinds of ignorance. 

1. having never been in a fast-growing startup, they do not understand how the stages of growth will differ.
2. they do not realize how those very different stages will cause dramatic changes in the challenges faced by the CEO and the executive team. 
3. They do not yet know whether or not they have the skills and capabilities to address those challenges. 
4. they have not had to reflect on whether they will be willing to trade off control versus value creation and are therefore less prepared to make decisions that are consistent with their core motivations.
