1. Get your head right. it ways heavily on the chief execs. Focus on the future
2. do not delay. time between decision and execution should be as short as possible. there are always leaks and people talk, notice it. also it's fair for the employee. 
3. be clear in your mind why you're laying people off. the message should be, the company fails and we have to let some people go in order to move forward
4. train your managers. managers must lay off their own people. 1. explain briefly why (companiy fail not persons). 2. employee should understand that decision is not negotiable. 3. be clear about support and benefits the company will provide them
5. address the entire company. provide context to everywhere. the message is for message how stay. treat people with respect.
6. be visible and present. engage with people. show that you care. let them know you appreciate their efforts
