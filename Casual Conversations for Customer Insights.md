Often an effective approach is to engage in **casual conversations**. For example, if youâ€™re developing a tool for public speakers and encounter one at a conference, directly asking about their experiences, or one of your 3 most important questions, can yield valuable insights without the need for formal scheduling. This informal method enables spontaneous learning and avoids the limitations of structured interviews.

Relying too heavily on scheduled meetings can lead to missed opportunities for unexpected yet valuable interactions. The "Meeting Anti-Pattern" , is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for customer conversation into a calendar block, highlights how formal meetings might be awkward and restrict the chance for unexpected feedback. **By opting for more relaxed conversations, such as those at industry events or in casual settings, you can gain deeper and more genuine understanding of customer needs efficiently.**
