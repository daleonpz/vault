To make the most of your meetings, having a structured process is crucial. Simply showing up without preparation can waste time and miss valuable insights. **If you don't even know what are you trying to learn, do not bother to even ask for a conversation**.

A solid process involves three main steps: prepping, reviewing, and taking good notes.

**Prepping**: Before the meeting, identify your top three big questions that you need answers to. These should be clear and focused to guide the conversation effectively. Spend time understanding what you already know and determine what new commitments or next steps you need from the meeting. Create a rough outline of what you think the person you’re meeting with cares about, even if your guesses are not perfect. Additionally, do some basic research on the person or company you’re meeting with to avoid looking uninformed. Gather your entire team for prep to ensure all relevant perspectives are included.

**Reviewing**: After the meeting, sit down with your team to go over your notes and update your key questions and beliefs based on what you learned. Discuss which questions worked well and which did not, and consider how you can improve future meetings. This step helps ensure that everyone is aligned with the new insights and keeps the team informed about important takeaways.

**Note-Taking**: Good notes are essential for keeping everyone in the loop and for future reference. Write down exact quotes when possible, as they can be useful for marketing, fundraising, or clarifying arguments later. Use symbols to quickly capture emotions and key ideas, such as :) for excitement, ☹ for pain, and ☑ for feature requests. This shorthand makes it easier to analyze and recall important details later.
