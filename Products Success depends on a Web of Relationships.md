While users are central to product and service design, success depends on cooperation from a broader network of people, organizations, and technical systems. An example is the early home radio, which, despite its simple functionality (changing stations and volume), succeeded because of engaging radio station broadcasts. The productâ€™s value was inseparable from the ecosystem supporting it.
