The term **interusability** refers to the user experience (UX) across multiple devices. 

The ultimate goal of cross-platform design is that the experience should feel coherent. **Does the service feel like the devices are working in concert, or does the UX feel fragmented?**

3 core principles of interusability that enable this coherence:

1. **Composition**: How devices and their functionalities are organized to complement each other.
2. **Consistency**: Appropriate similarity in interfaces across devices to maintain familiarity without sacrificing usability.
3. **Continuity**: Smooth transitions of content and data between platforms for a seamless experience.
