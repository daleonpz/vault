Pros:
- Gets you a bigger slice of the pie
- May give you cachet
- May provide free publicity
- May lead customers to buy your slower-moving products while waiting for the shortage at end

Cons:
- Shrinks the pie, costs you sales today
- May cost you a relationship and thereby future sales
- Crates ill will
- Leaves a hole in the market, inviting entry
