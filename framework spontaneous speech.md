The main idea is to introduce something, explain current state, explain future development
##### Pitching an idea or a product

**Structure:** _Problem, solution, benefit_

First discuss a challenge, a pain point, or an issue. Then present a product, an offering, an idea, or an action that would solve the problem. Conclude by describing the relevant advantages that would ensue.

##### Responding to someone who seeks your opinion on the spot

**Structure:** _Comparison, contrast, conclusion_

First articulate how the ideas, approaches, products, or arguments involved are similar. Next discuss how they differ. Then come to a conclusion and provide a rationale.

**Example:** You’re offering an opinion on two proposals for building the customer base.

_“Bob and Tina’s proposals both focus on building market share by targeting untapped groups via a phone app. Tina wants us to go after college students and people new to the workforce; Bob wants us to market to affinity groups. Either approach will win customers, but I favor Tina’s strategy, for two reasons: It’s easier to target college students and new employees, and they’re likely to be more tech-savvy and open to using an app.”_

##### Answering questions

**Structure:** _Answer, detailed example, relevance_

First answer the question clearly and simply, preferably in one sentence. Next offer an illustration or an example that supports your answer. Then describe your answer’s relevance to your listeners or its benefits if they adopt it.

**Example:** You’re interviewing for a senior leadership position in the digital media industry, and the owner of the company asks you to describe your vision for it.

_“I believe that your success hinges on releasing your current media assets as short-form videos. When I was at Company XYZ, we migrated our content to short-form video over a three-year period and doubled our market share. On the basis of what I learned in my previous job, I think you could double your market share within 18 months.”_
