A product requires the ability to create (**Product Design**) , to sell (**Business**) and to produce (**Production**).

And **Product design revolves around the product’s function**—what it does. This is a central focus for designers, as function defines the purpose and utility of the object. Alongside function, three other factors are critical:

- **Form**: The product’s architecture, shape, color, texture, and overall structural appearance.
- **Materials**: The substances used in the product, which influence its durability, cost, and usability.
- **Manufacturing Processes**: The methods and techniques employed to produce the product, affecting its scalability and quality.

These four elements—function, form, materials, and processes—are deeply interconnected and form the foundation of thoughtful product design.
