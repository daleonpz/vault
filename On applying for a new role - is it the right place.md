Once you've received an offer, you'll enter the negotiation phase, where many hesitate to ask for what they truly want.

Before discussing salary, talk to the hiring manager about key priorities, such as addressing potential tech debt or other critical areas. **Ensure that the company is committed to setting you up for success, whether through training your future team, mentorship, or professional development. 

**While this conversation may seem bold, if the company is not receptive, consider it a red flag.** Approach the negotiation as collaboration, using phrases like "here's how I see it" and "does it make sense to you?".
