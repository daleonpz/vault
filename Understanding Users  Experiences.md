When mapping user experiences, let participants define the starting and ending points of their timelines. This approach uncovers insights beyond assumptions. For instance, in a home security project, designers might assume the process starts when the key enters the lock. However, participants might identify the start as the frantic search for misplaced keys.

This broader perspective can reveal pain points, like the stress of lost keys, leading to innovations such as better key management solutions or keyless entry systems. Letting users frame the timeline ensures the design aligns with their lived experiences and needs
