Mood boards (also called “design themes” or “visual language boards”) are collages of pictures or words describing a conceptual direction or target audience taste. They can look at form factors, materials, colors, contexts, or other areas like architecture or fashion. 

Often, multiple mood boards are used to contrast and compare possible directions and provide designers with inspiration for their further exploration.

They are also used to describe and analyze competitors, design trends, or user profiles. Mood boards are a great addition to personas, a tool that should be familiar from UX design. In this case, the collages help describe what products, brands, CMF (color, material, finish), or envi­ronments are relevant to the persona. This is useful to set a design direction early and focus the concept generation phase.
