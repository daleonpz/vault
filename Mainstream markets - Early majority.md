Early Majority: The Pragmatists
Pragmatists are a distinct group characterized by their desire for incremental, measurable, and predictable progress. Unlike visionaries who seek quantum leaps, pragmatists aim for percentage improvements in their endeavors. They are risk-averse and view risk negatively, perceiving it as a potential waste of time and money. Pragmatists prefer to establish safety nets and closely manage risks before undertaking any new venture.

While pragmatists may be challenging to initially win over, they display strong loyalty once convinced, often standardizing their purchases from a single company for specific requirements. They prioritize factors such as the company's reputation, product quality, supporting infrastructure, system interfaces, and service reliability, as they anticipate a long-term commitment to their decisions.

Establishing partnerships with established vendors or becoming a value-added reseller (VAR) can facilitate entry into the pragmatist market. Pragmatists prefer buying from proven market leaders because third parties tend to design supporting products around such leading products.

In sum, to the pragmatist buyer, **the most powerful evidence of leadership and likelihood of competitive victory is market share**. In the absence of definitive numbers here, pragmatists will look to the quality and number of partners and allies you have assembled in your camp. You also have to make sure that everyone hears about it.

Price sensitivity is moderate among pragmatists. They are willing to pay a modest premium for exceptional quality or specialized services. However, in the absence of differentiation, they seek the best value for their investment. This approach is driven by the fact that they are consistently measured on their ability to balance expenses and returns, as they have typically made long-term career commitments to their jobs and companies
