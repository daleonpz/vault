Exclusive distribution may have great benefits for a struggling entrepreneur. It's usually easier to make a exclusive deal, because retailer won't have to fight for competition, and your product may sell more as part of a bundle.

But being trapped in a exclusivity contract during a long period may cost a lot of money, because if your products is well accepted in the market, you cannot exploit that opportunity.
