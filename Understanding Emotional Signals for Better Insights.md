When dealing with emotional signals, it's crucial to dig deeper to uncover their origins, just as you would with feature requests. Strong emotions, whether anger, embarrassment, or joy, can reveal important insights. For instance, if someone expresses frustration about a problem, it's essential to explore why it affects them so deeply rather than just noting it down.

To explore feature requests, ask questions like: **“Why do you want that?”** or **“How are you managing without it?”** For emotional signals, use questions such as: **“Tell me more about that”** or “What makes it so awful?”  or **“Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”**

These inquiries allow individuals to elaborate on their feelings and provide valuable context. The goal is to understand the root cause of their emotions and not just to react to them. This approach helps in gathering comprehensive feedback that can drive better decisions and improvements.
