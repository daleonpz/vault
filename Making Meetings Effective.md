### **Making Meetings Effective: Getting Commitments**

Meetings either succeed or fail—there’s no middle ground. A meeting is a failure if you leave with just compliments or vague promises like "Let's talk after the holidays." Success happens when you end with a clear commitment for the next step. Without this, meetings just waste time.

You might fall into two traps:

1. Asking for opinions or compliments without seeking a real commitment.
2. Not asking for clear next steps.

Compliments should be deflected and ignored; focus on getting a commitment instead. If you don’t ask for clear next steps, it’s a failure. Even if you get rejected, at least you know where you stand. Always ensure you know what will happen next after the meeting to make it worthwhile.

### Fixing a Bad Meeting

Bad meetings often end with vague comments or compliments. For example, if someone says, "That’s so cool. I love it!" it's just a compliment and not useful feedback. Similarly, comments like "Looks great. Let me know when it launches," are polite ways to delay or avoid commitment. To fix this, ask for specific next steps or commitments.

A good meeting is one where you can ask for concrete actions, such as buying a prototype or setting up a follow-up meeting with other decision-makers. If you’re not getting real commitments, push for them or seek other opportunities to validate your product.
