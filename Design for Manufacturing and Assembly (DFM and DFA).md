The manufacturing phase often uncovers the need for design changes to suit production methods and materials. For instance, plastic injection molding requires careful consideration of flow, cooling rates, and structural features like wall thickness or corners to prevent defects such as warping. These details significantly impact whether a product is perceived as high or low quality, as simplicity and elegance often rely on sophisticated engineering and **Design for Manufacturing (DFM).**

Another critical aspect is **Design for Assembly (DFA),** which focuses on optimizing how a product is put together. This includes simplifying parts to reduce assembly steps, ensuring quality control, and enabling faster, more efficient processes for workers. By addressing these considerations, products can achieve both aesthetic and functional excellence while streamlining production.
