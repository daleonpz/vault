Domain knowledge is essential for effective design, as it integrates insights from engineering physics, technical fields, and observations of existing products. **This foundation in science and engineering provides the critical principles and tools designers rely on to create functional and innovative solutions.

**A designerâ€™s challenge lies in developing a device to meet a need that is often only partially defined.** This requires leveraging domain expertise to bridge gaps in understanding, ensuring the final product addresses the underlying requirements while pushing technical boundaries.
