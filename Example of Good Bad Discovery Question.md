1. **“Do you think it’s a good idea?”**
    
    - **Bad Question**
    - **Why It Fails**: This question seeks an opinion rather than actionable data. It’s likely to receive a positive response because people generally don’t want to hurt your feelings.
    - **Improvement**: Instead, ask about the specifics of their current problem and how they’re solving it. For example: “Can you describe how you currently manage [problem]? What are the biggest pain points?”
2. **“Would you buy a product which did X?”**
    
    - **Bad Question**
    - **Why It Fails**: This question is speculative and based on what people might do in the future, which is often unreliable.
    - **Improvement**: Focus on current behaviors and challenges. For example: “How do you currently handle X? What’s the most frustrating part of that process?”
3. **“How much would you pay for X?”**
    
    - **Bad Question**
    - **Why It Fails**: Asking about pricing in the abstract can lead to unreliable answers as it’s a hypothetical scenario.
    - **Improvement**: Determine what they’re currently paying for similar solutions or how much value they place on solving the problem. For example: “What’s the most you’ve paid for a solution to this problem?”
4. **“What would your dream product do?”**
    
    - **Bad Question**
    - **Why It Fails**: This invites a broad and often unrealistic wishlist rather than focusing on practical needs.
    - **Improvement**: Dive into their actual needs and frustrations. For example: “Can you tell me about the last time you faced this problem? What was the most difficult part of it?”
5. **“Why do you bother?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: This question helps uncover the underlying motivations and real problems beyond surface-level symptoms.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it effectively uncovers deeper insights into the customer’s situation.
6. **“What are the implications of that?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: It helps distinguish between significant problems and minor annoyances, providing insight into the true value of a solution.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it effectively clarifies the importance and impact of the problem.
7. **“Talk me through the last time that happened.”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: Asking for specific examples helps uncover detailed, concrete information about the customer’s experiences.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it provides valuable context and details.
8. **“Talk me through your workflow.”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: Understanding their workflow reveals practical aspects of how they handle their tasks and where pain points occur.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it helps in identifying inefficiencies and needs.
9. **“What else have you tried?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: This question reveals past solutions and their shortcomings, helping you understand what’s already been attempted and what’s lacking.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it provides context on existing solutions and gaps.
10. **“Would you pay X for a product which did Y?”**
    
    - **Bad Question**
    - **Why It Fails**: This is another hypothetical question that doesn’t provide actionable insights into current behaviors or constraints.
    - **Improvement**: Instead, ask about their current spending and the value of the problem. For example: “What’s the most you’ve invested in solving this problem so far?”
11. **“How are you dealing with it now?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: This question provides insight into the current solutions they use, their costs, and their pain points.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it helps understand their current situation and spending.
12. **“Where does the money come from?”**
    
    - **Good Question (for B2B context)**
    - **Why It Works**: In a business context, this question identifies who controls the budget and who else is involved in the decision-making process.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it’s crucial for understanding purchasing dynamics and potential roadblocks.
13. **“Who else should I talk to?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: It helps you expand your network and reach more relevant stakeholders who might influence or be involved in the decision-making process.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it’s useful for broadening your customer discovery efforts.
14. **“Is there anything else I should have asked?”**
    
    - **Good Question**
    - **Why It Works**: This open-ended question encourages the interviewee to share any additional insights or aspects that might not have been covered.
    - **Improvement**: No change needed; it allows for valuable, unsolicited information.

By focusing on concrete experiences, current challenges, and specific details, rather than opinions or hypotheticals, you can gather more actionable insights that guide your development efforts effectively.
