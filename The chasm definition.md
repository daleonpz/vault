the point of greatest peril in thedevelopment of a high-tech market lies in making the transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary customers to a
mainstream market dominated by a large block of customers who are predominantly pragmatists in orientation. 

It would be much better if you could start with a fad, exploit it for all it was worth,
and then turn it into a trend. That is in essence what high-tech marketing is all about. Every truly innovative high-tech product starts out as a fad—something with no known market value or purpose but with “great properties” that generate a lot of enthusiasm within an “in crowd” of early adopters.
**That’s the early market**. Then comes a period during which the rest of the world
watches to see if anything can be made of this; that is the chasm.

The spaces between segments indicate the credibility gap that arises from seeking to use the group on the left as a reference base to penetrate the segment on the right.
