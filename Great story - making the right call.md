If your pricing is confusing or hard to figure out, the customers would probably hard to figure it out and decide if it makes to switch the provider.  But still, it could open the door to other offers with simpler pricing (different, anti stereotype)

what do you pay for a minute of long-distance calls? not sure? we thought so. The pricing is a big fog.

In Japan, there's another layer of complexity. The phone companies there even charge for local calls. This pricing fog is a problem for DDI (a company) as it tries to gain market share againt the dominant carrier, NTT. For some calls, DDI is cheaper; for others, NTT. But which carrier is cheaper overall?

DDI has found a way to solve this problem. In partnership with Kyocera, a major stakeholder, DDI has developed a chip that gois inside the phone. The chip stores the prices that DDI and NTT are charging and automatically routes ecah phone call via the lower-cost provider.  

Now customers don't have to worry about pricing and DDI is sure to get their business whenever it has the better price.
