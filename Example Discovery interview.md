## Failing the Mom Test

**Son:** “Mom, mom, I have an idea for a business — can I run it by you?”  
I am about to expose my ego — please don’t hurt my feelings.

**Mom:** “Of course, dear.”  
You are my only son and I am ready to lie to protect you.

**Son:** “You like your iPad, right? You use it a lot?”

**Mom:** “Yes.”  
You led me to this answer, so here you go.

**Son:** “Okay, so would you ever buy an app which was like a cookbook for your iPad?”  
I am optimistically asking a hypothetical question and you know what I want you to say.

**Mom:** “Hmmm.”  
As if I need another cookbook at my age.

**Son:** “And it only costs $40 — that’s cheaper than those hardcovers on your shelf.”  
I’m going to skip that lukewarm signal and tell you more about my great idea.

**Mom:** “Well...”  
Aren’t apps supposed to cost a dollar?

**Son:** “And you can share recipes with your friends, and there’s an iPhone app which is your shopping list. And videos of that celebrity chef you love.”  
Please just say “yes.” I will not leave you alone until you do.

**Mom:** “Oh, well yes honey, that sounds amazing. And you’re right, $40 is a good deal. Will it have pictures of the recipes?”  
I have rationalized the price outside of a real purchase decision, made a non-committal compliment, and offered a feature request to appear engaged.

**Son:** “Yes, definitely. Thanks mom — love you!”  
I have completely misinterpreted this conversation and taken it as validation.

**Mom:** “Won’t you have some lasagna?”  
I am concerned that you won’t be able to afford food soon. Please eat something.

## Passing the Mom Test

**Son:** “Hey mom, how’s that new iPad treating you?”

**Mom:** “Oh - I love it! I use it every day.”

**Son:** “What do you usually do on it?”  
Whoops — we asked a generic question, so the answer to this probably won’t be terribly valuable.

**Mom:** “Oh, you know. Read the news, play sudoku, catch up with my friends. The usual.”

**Son:** “What’s the last thing you did on it?”  
Get specific about examples in the past to get real, concrete data.

**Mom:** “You know your father and I are planning that trip? I was figuring out where we could stay.”  
She uses it for both entertainment and utility, which didn’t come up during the “usually” answer.

**Son:** “Did you use an app for that?”  
A slightly leading question, but sometimes we need to nudge to get to the topic we’re interested in.

**Mom:** “No, I just used Google. I didn’t know there was an app. What’s it called?”  
Younger folks use the App Store as a search engine, whereas your mom waits for a specific recommendation. If that’s true more broadly, finding a reliable marketing channel outside the App Store is going to be crucial.

**Son:** “Where did you find out about the other ones you use?”  
Dig into interesting and unexpected answers to understand the behaviors and motivations behind them.

**Mom:** “The Sunday paper has a section on the apps of the week.”  
You can’t remember the last time you cracked open a paper, but it sounds like traditional PR might be a viable option for reaching customers like your mom.

**Son:** “Makes sense. Hey, by the way, I saw a couple new cookbooks on the shelf — where did those come from?”  
Business ideas usually have several failure points. Here it’s both the medium of an iPad app and the content of a cookbook.

**Mom:** “They’re one of those things you just end up getting at Christmas. I think Marcy gave me that one. Haven’t even opened it. As if I need another lasagna recipe at my age!”  
Aha! This answer is gold dust for 3 reasons:
1. Old people don’t need another generic set of recipes.
2. The gift market may be strong.
3. Younger cooks may be a better customer segment since they don’t yet know the basics.

**Son:** “What’s the last cookbook you did buy for yourself?”  
Attack generic answers like “I don’t buy cookbooks” by asking for specific examples.

**Mom:** “Now that you mention it, I bought a vegan cookbook about 3 months ago. Your father is trying to eat healthier and thought my veggies could benefit from a pinch more zazz.”  
More gold: experienced chefs may still buy specialized or niche cookbooks.
