Innovators: The Technology Enthusiasts
Classically, the first people to adopt any new technology are those who appreciate the technology for its own sake. They are the ones who first appreciate the architecture of your product and why it therefore has a competitive advantage
over the current crop of products established in the market place. They are the ones who will spend hours trying to get products to work that, in all conscience, never should have been shipped in the first place. 

To give some high-tech examples, technology enthusiasts are the ones who buy HDTVs, home networking solutions, and digital cameras when they each cost well over a thousand dollars.

As a buying population, First,and most crucially, they want the truth, and without any tricks. Second, wherever possible, whenever they have a technical problem, they want access to the most technically knowledge able person to answer it. Third, they want to be first to get the new stuff. By working with them under nondisclosure—a commitment to which they typically adhere scrupulously—you can get great feedback early in the design cycle and begin building a supporter who will influence buyers not only in his own company but elsewhere in the marketplace as well. Finally, they want everything cheap.

That said, for the most part, these people are not powerful enough to dictate the buying decisions of others, nor do they represent a significant market in themselves. What they represent instead is a sounding board for initial product or service features and a test bed for introducing modifications to the product or service until it is thoroughly "debugged".
