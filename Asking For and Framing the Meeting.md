When you're reaching out to someone for a meeting, especially if you don't have a concrete product to pitch or if you're targeting someone senior, how you frame your request can make all the difference. Here’s how to ask for and frame a meeting effectively:

#### The Right Way to Ask for a Meeting

1. **State Your Vision Clearly**  
    Start by explaining what you’re trying to achieve. Be specific about the problem you’re addressing or the vision you’re working towards, but avoid discussing your product in detail. Focus on the broader goal.
    
2. **Set Expectations**  
    Make it clear what stage you’re at and that you’re not trying to sell anything. This helps in reducing any perceived pressure on the other person and sets a collaborative tone.
    
3. **Show Your Weakness**  
    Acknowledge what you don’t know or the specific problem you’re facing. This shows that you value their expertise and are genuinely seeking their help.
    
4. **Put Them on a Pedestal**  
    Highlight why you think they’re the right person to help. Mention their expertise or experience that makes them uniquely qualified to provide insights.
    
5. **Ask for Help Directly**  
    Make a clear, specific request for their time or advice. This shows respect for their time and makes it easier for them to say yes.
    

**Example:**

_Hey Pete,_

_I’m working on making desk and office rental easier for new businesses (vision). We’re just starting out and don’t have anything to sell yet, but we want to ensure we’re solving real problems (framing). I’ve only experienced the rental process from a tenant’s perspective and am struggling to understand the landlord’s side (weakness). You’ve been managing desk rentals for a while, and your insights would be invaluable (pedestal)._

_Could we schedule a time in the next couple of weeks to chat? (ask)_

**Alternative Example:**

_Hey Scott,_

_I run a startup focused on making advertising more engaging and effective (vision). We’re having difficulties understanding how the industry fits together and where we can position ourselves (weakness). Your deep knowledge of the advertising industry could really help us avoid some major pitfalls (pedestal)._

_We’re funded and have some products out already, but this isn’t a sales meeting — we’re just looking for guidance as we enter this new area (framing)._

_Could we meet for coffee sometime next week? (ask)_

#### During the Meeting

1. **Reiterate Your Framing**  
    At the beginning of the meeting, briefly restate the purpose and your current status. This helps set the stage and ensures everyone is on the same page.
    
2. **Establish Authority**  
    If someone made the introduction, mention them to establish some authority and context. This can help in building credibility and focusing the discussion.
    
3. **Take Control of the Meeting**  
    Keep the conversation on track. Have a plan for the meeting, including key questions you want to ask and topics you need to cover. Ensure you’re driving the discussion rather than letting it drift into unrelated areas.
    
4. **Ask Insightful Questions**  
    Use the information you've gathered to ask specific, insightful questions. This demonstrates that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in their perspective.
    

**Example:**

_Hey Tim, thanks for meeting with me. As I mentioned in the email, we’re trying to make it easier for universities to spin out student businesses (vision). We’re still figuring out the process and need guidance (framing & weakness)._

_Tom introduced us because of your unique insight into university spinouts and we believe you can help us navigate this (pedestal)._

_I noticed your spinout portfolio is impressive, particularly company X. Could you share how they progressed from your classroom to their current success? (grab the reins and ask good questions)_

#### Summary

- **Vision**: Explain your overarching goal or problem.
- **Framing**: Clarify your current stage and that you're not selling anything.
- **Weakness**: Identify the specific area where you need help.
- **Pedestal**: Acknowledge their expertise and why they’re the right person to help.
- **Ask**: Make a clear, specific request for their time or advice.

This approach not only shows respect for their time but also sets the stage for a productive conversation. By being clear about your needs and their potential contribution, you make it easier for them to provide valuable insights and support.
