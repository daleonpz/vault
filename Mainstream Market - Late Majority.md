Late Majority: The Conservatives
Conservatives make up around one-third of customers in the Technology Adoption Life Cycle model and tend to be cautious about high-tech products. They typically invest in mature, low-cost, and commoditized technology at the end of the product life cycle. To succeed in the long term, high-tech businesses need to create a compelling reason for conservatives to do business with them.

Conservatives prefer single-function devices for activities like music, video, email, and games, rather than all-in-one devices. High-tech companies can capitalize on this market by repackaging low-cost, trailing-edge technology components into single-function systems tailored to specific business needs.

There are two keys to success here. The first is to have thoroughly thought through the “whole solution” to a particular target end-user market’s needs, and to have provided for every element of that solution within the package. This is critical because there is no profit margin to support an after-purchase support system. The other key is to have lined up a low-overhead distribution channel that can get this package to the target market effectively. In this context, the rise of “as-a-service” offerings delivered over the Web creates a magnificent opportunity to make progress with this segment.
