Determining the level of interactivity in connected devices involves balancing cost, usability, and functionality. Physical controls like buttons and switches add material and development costs but can make devices easier to use. However, incorporating many features risks complicating the interface, a challenge known as the **"flexibility-usability tradeoff."**

Simpler devices with limited physical controls may depend heavily on external systems, like apps or web interfaces, making them vulnerable to issues beyond the designerâ€™s control (e.g., internet outages). For example, the first Tado thermostat offered full control via an app but included a physical button for basic fallback functionality, ensuring usability even without internet access.

A hybrid approach, as seen in the **Cloudwash** washing machine prototype, strikes a balance. It provides physical controls for common tasks while relying on apps for more advanced features. Flexible physical interfaces, such as controls paired with displays, offer adaptability without overwhelming the user, blending simplicity with functionality.
