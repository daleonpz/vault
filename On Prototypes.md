* The best prototype is one that, in the simplest and the most efficient way, makes the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable.

* Prototypes are experiments made to answer specific questions. Prototyping starts before a product concept is chosen, and continues long after launch. Decide what questions you want to answer before making a prototype will keep you from wasting time and effort. 

* Connected objects become meaningful as components of services. To prototype the relationship among service components, the key is staying at a high level to avoid getting stuck in the details of any individual component.
