In theory, there is not difference between theory and practice.
In practice, there is a difference.

**There many companies that don't think or care about customer needs**. Thus, two main drivers to product feature:
* add features to max the competition
* add features driver by a new technology
None of them focus on customer needs

**Law of Product development**
> The day the product development starts, it's behind scheduled and above budget.

Usually schedules are influenced by external factors like holidays, supplier problems, etc.

Product development takes time to even started. Hiring people, understand the problem, interview people, etc. Time that is not usually considered in schedule.

"We don't have the time or money right now to develop that feature right. Next time, we'll do it right...."  but next time the same argument is repeated.

**Focus finding the RIGHT Problem, and the RIGHT Solution**
