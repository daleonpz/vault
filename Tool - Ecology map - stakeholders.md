Service ecology maps:
• Give you a way to keep track of relevant actors and stakeholders
• Surface relationships among those actors and stakeholders
• Help you re-imagine how those actors and stakeholders might relate to each other Importantly, service ecology maps can visualize people, organizations, and even places **that are affected by use but are not users.**
