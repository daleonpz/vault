In a kitchen, there are many devices and tools, and people who uses that kitchen have no problem working in it, but if a new person comes , this person will struggle.  

That means **Confusion in the in the mind**. 

Life is complex, as well the tasks we encounter. Our tools must match the task. 

Complexity is essential, but confusion is not. **Things are complicated because there is confusion.**

A good conceptional model is the best way to attack Complexity.

Even in an apparent chaos, there are some structure that people understand.

**Complex things are not complicated once they are understood.**
