Nutrasweet's european patent expired in 1987, fire years before the US-patent. Although the european market for aspartame was small, and not especially valuable in its own right, the game in Europe was an important harbinger of things to come in the US.

Holland Sweetener entered the EU market with a small, 500-tonne plant. There was an elemen tfo judo in Holland's strategy. NutraSweet owned the market. Cutting price to kill off the challenger would hurt NutraSweet much more than ceding some share. And yet, shortly after Holland's entry, NutraSweet cut price aggressively, triggering a price war.  By early 1990, aspartane prices in EU had fallen from $70 to $22-30 per pound, and Holland was losing money.

NutraSweet was looking ahead, even if at that moment NutraSweet was losing money in EU, to the time when the US market would open up. Holland's 500 tonnes would serve 5 percent of the world market. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that Holland made money, it would have a natural temptation to expand. 

By fighting in EU, NutraSweet denied Holland access to the US, plus it send an aggressive signal to any other entrants.
