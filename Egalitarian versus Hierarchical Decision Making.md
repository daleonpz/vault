"If there isn’t an obvious quarterback, who can call plays for the team, it is dangerous to choose one of the founders as the quarterback. If there isn’t a capablequarterback on the founding team, it should tell you that there is a hole in the founding team. I had a friend who founded a company with three other engineers and they arbitrarily declared one of the engineers as the quarterback. That founder had no experience managing a team and he started making bad decisions. That team would have been better off making collective decisions until they found the right quarterback, either as another cofounder or as a hired CEO."

"It is important for someone to be the ‘quarterback,’ as you need one person calling plays on the field. A quarterback needs to call a play, you go run the play, then everyone comes back to the huddle and shares info, and another play is called. If the quarterback isn’t listening to the inputs and adjusting the play calling, the team loses and a different quarterback is selected.”
