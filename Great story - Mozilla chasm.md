Here’s what they did do:
1. Targeted the “next two billion” Web users, embracing the constraint that they would not be able to afford anything more than free open-source software, but who would be willing to accept a product optimized for price/performance as opposed to the latest features, and who would require a hyper-low-cost platform, which they had the technology to deliver.
2. Recruited two key mobile operators, Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom, to anchor this effort because, as their CEO at the time, Gary Kovacs, put it, “They write the checks.”
3. Leveraged their support to recruit two key device manufacturers - ZTE and TCL (formerly Alcatel) to supply Firefox-enabled devices.
4. Held summits, councils, and multi-party planning days over the course of more than a year to get the ecosystem aligned both at the executive and the operating levels.
5. Fought to maintain a common core set of standards for the platform, despite pressure from every side to support “specials,” so that the end result was truly scalable at a globallevel.
6. Led a launch at the 2013 Mobile World Congress where Kovacs was joined onstage by twenty-three other CEOs, each of whom had signed a commitment to launch a Firefox-enabled device in at least one country.
