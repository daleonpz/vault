In unit testing, a crucial concept is that **"unit tests are narrowly scoped in terms of the code being validated, not the code being executed."** This highlights the focus of a unit test on verifying specific functionality rather than controlling all the code that gets executed during the test. 

- **Narrow Scope (Validated Code)**: The test focuses on verifying a specific unit, such as a method or function, ensuring it behaves according to its specifications. For example, if testing a method like `calculateTotalPrice()` in a `ShoppingCart` class, the test is concerned only with whether this method produces the correct result based on the business logic.
    
- **Broader Execution (Executed Code)**: Even though the test focuses on a specific unit, other parts of the code (e.g., other methods or classes) may be executed during the process. In the `calculateTotalPrice()` example, this method may call other functions like `applyDiscounts()` or `calculateTax()`. However, the goal is not to validate these secondary functions; their behavior is controlled through mocking or stubbing to isolate the functionality being tested.
    
This distinction ensures that unit tests remain focused, validating a single functionality while still accounting for the broader execution environment.
