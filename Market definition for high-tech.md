A market is:
• a set of actual or potential customers
• for a given set of products or services
• who have a common set of needs or wants, and
• **who reference each other when making a buying decision.**

If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market. That is, if I sell an oscilloscope for monitoring heartbeats to a doctor in Boston and the identical product
for the same purpose to a doctor in Zaire, and these two doctors have no reasonable basis for communicating with each other, then I am dealing in two different markets. 

Similarly, if I sell an oscilloscope to a doctor in Boston and then go next door and sell the same product to an engineer working on a sonar device, I am also dealing in two different markets. **In both cases, the reason we have separate markets is that the customers could not have referenced each other.**
