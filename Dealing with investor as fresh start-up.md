Dealing with investors can be daunting, particularly for new entrepreneurs, but there are several strategies that founders can use to gain leverage. Jim Triandiflou deliberately waited until his startup had a solid product, cash flow, and customer contracts before approaching VCs, judging correctly that this strategy would result in higher valuations. He also avoided working with a single VC firm, in order to avoid the control over decision making that a single VC with two board seats would have.
Instead, he split the first round between two VC firms, each of which took one seat on the board.
“Two guys from the same firm can monopolize decisions, and not giving any one person or group control is critical,” Jim explained. “My having board control is less important than my making sure someone else doesn’t have it.”
