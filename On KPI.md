Any measurement is better than none. But the **Measurement must cover the OUTPUT fo the activity** and not simply the activity involve.  

You measure a salemen for the make of deals made not but the number of calls made.

- A good indicator should measure a physical, countable thing.
- Joint monitoring is likely to keep things in the optimum middle ground. 

Activity -> Output Indicator
Accounts payable -> Vouchers processed
Customer service -> Sales orders entered
