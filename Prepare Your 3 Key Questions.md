To make the most out of any conversation, always pre-plan the three most important questions you want to ask. This approach helps you avoid bias and keeps the discussion focused on crucial topics rather than trivialities. By determining these key questions in advance, you’ll be better prepared to confront challenging issues and gather valuable insights.

Each type of person you speak with will require a tailored set of questions. If you’re dealing with different customer segments or partners, create a specific list for each group. Don’t stress about finding the perfect questions; choose the ones that seem most pressing or unclear at the moment. **This will give you a solid foundation for your discussions and help you build on previous insights.** 

If you meet someone unexpectedly, having your list of key questions allows you to make the most of the encounter and keep the conversation productive and casual.
