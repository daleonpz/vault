- **Authentication Scalability Issues**: Traditional user authentication methods may not work for the growing number of IoT devices (e.g., logging into a thermostat each time).

- **During Manufacturing**:
    - Low-cost manufacturing prioritize affordability over to security.
    - Installed software during manufacturing may be already old upon purchase.
    
- **Security Breaches and Damage Control**:
    - Devices should be designed to minimize harm when compromised.
    - A breach in one area should not enable malware or criminals to take over control of the entire system. 
      
- **Outdated Devices and Security**: Devices that can’t be updated may disable security-critical features or shut down to mitigate risks.
    
- **Physical Security of Devices** Take measures to prevent physical tampering 
  
- **Device Authentication** Devices must verify each other’s identity securely (e.g., car proving it's your car before unlocking the garage) either every time, or by a third-party (like in internet with DNS verification) or some other mechanism.
      
- **Tailored Security Measures**: Security solutions must be appropriate for the user and domain (appropriate Thread model).
  
  * One important part of privacy is about controlling information: **what is released and who sees what.**
