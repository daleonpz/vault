The model includes **technology**, **data**, **human**, and **institutional layers**, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how systems work together.

1. **Technology Layer**: The foundational level, ensuring devices can physically transmit signals to one another. Without this basic capability, no communication or interaction can occur.
    
2. **Data Layer**: Ensures devices can interpret and understand each other's messages, requiring compatibility in protocols and shared data models. Issues here, such as using the wrong printer driver, result in communication failures even when devices are connected.
    
3. **Human Layer**:  Can people understand and act effectively on the information received? 
   Focuses on the usability of the technology for people, considering factors like language, culture, and user needs. For example, an IoT product designed for one market may face challenges when deployed in others due to different cultural and practical contexts.
    
4. **Institutional Layer**: The extend to which societal systems can engage effectively around the system. This includes navigating legal frameworks like differing privacy laws across regions.
