When deciding between in-person meetings and phone or Skype calls, each option has its benefits and drawbacks.  But remember, **"hardly anyone makes friends over the phone".**
#### **Best Practices**

1. **Start In-Person**  
    For initial meetings or crucial conversations, start with in-person interactions whenever possible. This helps in establishing a solid foundation and building rapport.
    
2. **Use Phone or Skype Strategically**  
    Reserve phone or Skype calls for follow-ups, quick check-ins, or when in-person meetings arenâ€™t feasible. Ensure that these calls are well-structured and to the point.
    
3. **Set Clear Objectives**  
    Regardless of the medium, be clear about the purpose of the conversation and what you hope to achieve. This helps in keeping the discussion focused and productive.
        
4. **Adapt to Your Audience**  
    Understand your customers' preferences and constraints. Some may prefer the convenience of remote calls, while others may value face-to-face interactions. Flexibility is key.
