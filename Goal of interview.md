The purpose of the interview is to:
• select a good performer
• educate him as to who you and the company are
• determine if a mutual match exists
• sell him on the job

When you ask a question, a garrulous or nervous person might go on and on with his
answer long after you’ve lost interest. Most of us will sit and listen until the end out of courtesy. Instead, you should interrupt and stop him, because if you don’t, you are wasting your only asset—the interview time, in which you have to get as much information and insight as possible. So when things go off the track, get them back on
quickly. Apologize if you like, and say, “I would like to change the subject to X, Y, or Z.” The interview is yours to control, and if you don’t, you have only yourself to blame.

An interview produces the most insight if you steer the discussion toward subjects familiar to both you and the candidate. The person should talk about himself, his experience, what he has done and why, what he would have done differently if he had it to do over, and so forth, but this should be done in terms familiar to you, so that you
can evaluate its significance. In short, make sure the words used mean the same thing to both of you.
