A key challenge in product and service design is managing imbalances between effort and reward. This means asking: **who (or what) does the work for the product or service to function, and who benefits from it?** If the effort required isn’t meaningful or adequately compensated for certain users, the product risks failure. For example, a home security system involving tasks that teenagers find unrewarding and irrelevant could lead to poor outcomes.

To address these imbalances, such considerations must be built into the product definition phase, influencing business models, user experiences, and technical solutions. Additionally, three major sources of friction should be evaluated during this phase:

1. **Persuasion and behavior change**: How much effort is required to convince users to adopt new behaviors?
2. **Data ownership and sharing**: Who controls and benefits from the data generated?
3. **Machine automation vs. human action**: What tasks are automated, and which require user effort?

These questions don’t apply universally, but treating them as topics for thoughtful debate ensures a more balanced and effective design.
