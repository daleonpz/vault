All manufactures want a second source. The **Problem** is that they DO NOT necessarily want to do business with it.

That's why sometimes the most valuable service you can offer is creating competition, so DO NOT just give it away.  **You need to get paid to play**

Ask for cash is often not smart, but you can ask:
- for contributions toward bid-preparation expenses
- for a guaranteed sales contract
- for a better / inside information about the business. To give you more chances to win the bid.
- for a meeting with a senior management
- the customer to quote a price at which he would give you his business.
