In light of these cautionary tales, let me just close this section with a word of warning. If you try out this exercise of choosing the competition, and have trouble finding either a single, clear market alternative, or a credible second vendor leveraging your type of disruptive technology, this is a clue. **It means that you are probably not ready to cross the chasm. **

Choosing your market alternative wisely is the solution to this problem. But it has to be credible. And understand that, as soon as you call out your choice, you are in for a fight and your resources will be pushed in that direction.
