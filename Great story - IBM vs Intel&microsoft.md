If you do give up much of the pie to another company, the smart strategy is to acquire a piece of that company.

Early on, IBM had the financial resources to take a large equity position in both Intel and Microsoft. It did make an investment in Intel in 1982, getting a 20 percent equity stake and warrents to purchase another 10 percent. But, ironically, IMB sold out in 1986 and 1987 for $625 million. 

Ten years later that 20 percent stake would have been worth $25 billion. As for Microsoft, IMB had an opportunity to buy 30 percent of Microsoft for under $300 million in mid 1986. By the end of 1996, that invested would have been worth $33 billion.
