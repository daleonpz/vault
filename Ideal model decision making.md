Free discussion -> clear decision -> full support -> If wrong REPEAT

- Free discussion: all points of view and all aspects of an issue are openly
welcomed and debated. The greater the disagreement and controversy, the more important becomes the word free.  **knowledgeable people MUST NOT withhold opinions**

- Clear decision: the greater the disagreement about the issue, the more important becomes the word clear. When we know a decision is controversial we **MUST NOT** obscure matters to avoid an argument. 

- Fulll support: as long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a  
satisfactory outcome.

**COMMUNICATION**
A desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level.

**BE AWARE**: 
Because they often have trouble expressing their views forcefully, a hard time making
unpleasant or difficult decisions, and an even harder time with the idea that they are expected to support a decision with which they donâ€™t agree. It may take a while, but the logic of the ideal scheme will eventually win everyone over
