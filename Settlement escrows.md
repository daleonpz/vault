The buyer and seller agree to bring in a neutral thir player to act as mediator. The seller tells the mediator in private his selling price. The same applies to the buyer.  The mediator checks to see whether the two prices cross. If so, the mediator calculates the midpoint price, and seller and buyer transact at that price. Otherwise, the mediator announces only that the prices didn't cross.
