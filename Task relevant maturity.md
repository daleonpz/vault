Management style depends on the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.

But the manager must monitor closely the employee. Closely depends on the TRM. 

TASK-RELEVANT MATURITY OF SUBORDINATE -> CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT STYLE

1. low -> Structured; task-oriented; tell “what,”“when,” “how”
2. medium -> Individual-oriented; emphasis on two-way communication, support, mutual reasoning
3. high -> Involvement by manager minimal: establishing objectives and monitoring

TRM depends also on the enviroment. 

Let’s consider an army encampment where nothing ever happens. The sergeant in command has come to know each of his soldiers very well, and by and large maintains an informal relationship with them. The routines are so well established that he rarely has to tell anyone what to do; appropriate to the high TRM of the group, the sergeant contentshimself with merely monitoring their activity. 

But if things suddenly change we may have to revert quickly to the what-when-how mode.
