Vesting is the most common type of dynamic equity agreement. Vesting terms require founders to earn their equity stakes, either over a specified time or when they  accomplish specific milestones, rather than owning the equity from the start, as is the case with static equity splits.

Milestone-based vesting is one solution to such a problem. Team members earn a specific amount of equity for each of a well-defined set of milestones that, if accomplished, would add concrete value to the startup, but if milestones are not clear  it can cause its own problems.

While this approach aligns each additional award of equity with the addition of value to the startup, it is effective only when the team can (a) define objectively when each milestone has been achieved and (b) clearly link the achievement of each milestone to the founder(s) responsible for achieving it.
