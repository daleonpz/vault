These components represent areas where teams should balance efforts, ensuring that improving one doesn’t negatively impact the others. The five areas are:

1. **Quality of the Code**: How well-written and reliable the code is, including the effectiveness of tests and architecture.
2. **Attention from Engineers**: How often engineers reach a state of focus and avoid distractions.
3. **Intellectual Complexity**: The cognitive effort required for tasks, including dealing with unnecessary complexity.
4. **Tempo and Velocity**: The speed at which engineers complete tasks and release code.
5. **Satisfaction**: How content engineers are with their tools, processes, and overall job satisfaction.

An example of applying this framework is the readability process, which improved code quality, reduced complexity, and enhanced engineer satisfaction without needing to address every component (such as attention). This shows how goals can be tailored to specific situations.

**Signals** 
A signal is the way in which we will know we’ve achieved our goal. Not all signals are
measurable, but that’s acceptable at this stage. There is not a 1:1 relationship between
signals and goals. Every goal should have at least one signal, but they might have
more. Some goals might also share a signal.

**Metrics**
Metrics are where we finally determine how we will measure the signal. Metrics are
not the signal themselves; they are the measurable proxy of the signal. Because they
are a proxy, they might not be a perfect measurement. For this reason, some signals
might have multiple metrics as we try to triangulate on the underlying signal.
