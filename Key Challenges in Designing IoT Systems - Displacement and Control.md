#### **Displacement in Actions and Results**

IoT systems often create confusion by separating actions from their results:

1. **Displacement in Space**: Users may initiate an action, but the result happens elsewhere, causing unintended issues (e.g., accidentally turning on appliances or triggering alarms). Clear feedback is essential to confirm actions.
2. **Displacement in Time**: Actions set for the future (like turning off appliances) may be forgotten, leading to problems. Reminders or notifications can help users remember their scheduled actions.

#### **UX Risks of Autonomous Systems**

Autonomous systems can simplify tasks but present risks:

- **Reduced Control**: Too much system control can leave users feeling disempowered. There should always be an override option.
- **Frequent Permission Requests**: Constant permission requests can annoy users. Instead, systems should learn preferences and occasionally confirm changes.
- **Balancing Control and Autonomy**: Designers need to ensure users retain control while allowing the system to act autonomously when appropriate.

#### **Managing Complexity in IoT Systems**

As IoT systems grow more complex, these principles are key:

1. **Transparency**: Users should understand how the system works, which devices are interacting, and why actions happen.
2. **Sensible Device Integration**: New devices should be integrated intelligently, preventing conflicts.
3. **User Permissions**: Users need control over who can access devices and actions.
4. **Preventing Conflicts**: The system should anticipate potential issues, like rules that might interfere with each other.

IoT systems need to balance user control with system complexity. Designers must provide clear feedback, allow for manual overrides, and manage device interactions efficiently. As systems become more intelligent, transparency and intuitive management are essential to ensure they remain valuable and user-friendly.
