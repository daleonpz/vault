A player is your complementor 
- if customers value your product more when they have the other player's product than when they have your product alone.
- if it's more attractive for a supplier to provide resources to you when it's also supplying the other player than when it's supplying you alone.

Companies are **Complementors** in making markets but **Competitors** in dividing up markets.
