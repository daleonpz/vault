The place where most crossing-the-chasm marketing segmentation efforts get into trouble is at the beginning, when they focus on a target market or target segment instead of on a target customer.

This list consists of a set of issues around which go-to-market plans are built, each of which incorporates a chasm-crossing factor, as follows:
• Target customer
• Compelling reason to buy
• Whole product
• Partners and allies
• Distribution
• Pricing
• Competition
• Positioning
• Next target customer

So the rules of thumb in crossing the chasm are simple: Big enough to matter, small enough to lead, good fit with your crown jewels.
