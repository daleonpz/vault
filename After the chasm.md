Once early market leadership has been established, however, the entire equation changes. The whole product investment—securing the partnerships and alliances and then making them work to deliver the final goods—takes a significant number of funded initiatives. So does the channel development process, both on the pull and on the push sides, creating demand and providing incentives for sales. 

And **it is critical during this period to have an effective marketing communications program, including press relations, market relations, and advertising.**

In sum, this is when you want to spend your market development money—not before. It is important, therefore, that you not start this process until after you have established early market leadership, and that you not commit to throwing off all kinds of cash during the chasm period.
