It is crucial for founder-CEOs not only to diagnose and correct the problems that arise from hiring the wrong person, but also to anticipate when a decision that was good at the time may need to be rethought because the startup has arrived at a new stage of development. In the fast-paced world of startups, founders can’t afford to become entrenched in a particular way of hiring but must expect their startup’s hiring needs to change. For example, before hiring young employees during the early days of the startup, the founders should already be planning for the day when they will have to either replace those young hires or else hire more experienced people to supervise them; before building a team of generalists, the founders should already be considering how they will adjust when the startup requires the quality that can be provided only by specialists; before crafting a compensation package for the earliest hires, the founders should already be anticipating how different stages will require different packages. As we have seen throughout this chapter, the data indicate that each stage of a startup’s evolution is marked by important changes in its hiring needs.
